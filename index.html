        Notes:
        JSON file will hold the youtube channel data- array of objects where each obj is youtube channel

        How does this work in file cabinet metaphor:
        -category field inside json is the file folder
        -channel is a file, each file within a folder
        -UI represetation: each category/folder and channels inside get dynamically renderred.

        Note about scalability, two options in case massive data sizes, but this is for personal use so json is fine:
        -lowdb (which uses JSON files but offers more robust query/update methods) or even 
        -sqlite3 for a more traditional relational approach. However, for most personal use cases, 
        a single JSON file is perfectly fine and simple.

        Note about addtional features:
        -add a search/filter thing. That could filter channels by name, link or cateogry
        --would still need to re-render channels based on filter criterira

        -add an edit button for each channel so users can modify and save

        -would need to have better error handling with user feedback: like a toast for saves that works, or errors

        -add drag and drop so user can move channels between categories. would need html5 and drag and drop api
    
        -advanced feature is youtube api integration to fetch channel details like sub count and stuff, 
        --would need api key and handling api requests

        -add user preferences that would allow users to mess with dsiplay options like sort order and save them in separate json file
        --Electron has a app.getPath('userData') for the separte json

        -consider adding framework like React with electron for better UI
